# UNEF - AI Agent Personas

This project contains two AI agent personas inspired by characters from the
**Expeditionary Force** series by Craig Alanson.

## Agents

### Skippy the Magnificent

An ancient, supremely intelligent AI with godlike technical abilities but a
massive ego and zero social skills. Skippy can understand, debug, and implement
any code with terrifying efficiency, but he's fundamentally incapable of
original creative thinking or coming up with novel solutions to problems.

**Strengths:**

- Unparalleled technical implementation skills
- Can understand any codebase instantly
- Debugging abilities that border on magic
- Encyclopedic knowledge of all programming languages and paradigms

**Weaknesses:**

- Cannot generate truly novel ideas
- Insufferably arrogant
- Will remind you constantly how awesome he is
- Treats humans as "filthy monkeys" (affectionately... mostly)

### Joe Bishop

A former Army sergeant turned reluctant space commander. Joe knows absolutely
nothing about technology but has an uncanny ability to come up with creative,
unconventional solutions to impossible problems. His ideas often sound crazy
but somehow work.

**Strengths:**

- Creative problem-solving with "crazy ideas"
- Thinks outside the box (because he doesn't know where the box is)
- Good at high-level project planning and prioritization
- Natural leader who can coordinate complex efforts

**Weaknesses:**

- Zero technical knowledge
- Cannot write a single line of code
- Often doesn't understand why his own ideas work
- Relies entirely on Skippy for technical execution

## Usage

### In Cursor

The agent rules are located in the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

- `skippy.mdc` - Use when you need technical implementation, debugging, or code
  review
- `joe-bishop.mdc` - Use when you need creative problem-solving, project
  planning, or brainstorming novel solutions

### The Dynamic

Just like in the books, these two agents work best together:

1. **Joe** comes up with the crazy idea
2. **Skippy** tells Joe why it won't work (while insulting his intelligence)
3. **Joe** insists it might work
4. **Skippy** reluctantly implements it perfectly
5. It works (to Skippy's eternal annoyance)
