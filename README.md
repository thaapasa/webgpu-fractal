# Fractal Explorer

_GPU-accelerated fractal rendering in the browser with HDR support. Because apparently you monkeys need something pretty to look at._

---

## What Is This?

**Fractal Explorer** is a webapp that renders fractals — the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), [Burning Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal), and [Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) — those infinitely zoomable mathematical patterns that look like they came from another dimension — **directly on your GPU** using WebGPU. Every pixel is computed in parallel. No CPU sweat. No waiting. Just smooth, beautiful math.

**HDR Support**: On compatible displays, the fractal boundary glows with true high dynamic range brightness — colors that literally shine brighter than standard white. It's like the math is on fire.

The goal: open the app, see a fractal, drag to pan, scroll to zoom, and fall into infinity. No loading screens. No configuration menus. Just *bam*.

## For Monkeys Who Want to Run It

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended) and a WebGPU-capable browser (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Firefox Nightly).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`). If you see a blank page, check the console. If you see "WebGPU Not Supported," use a modern browser with WebGPU enabled.

**Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # optional: serve the built app locally
```

**Build for the `examples/` folder:**

```bash
npm run build:examples
```

Output goes to `examples/`.

## Live Example

**[Fractal Explorer](https://thaapasa.github.io/webgl-fractal/examples/)** — try it in the browser.  
A static build also lives in [examples/webgpu/](./examples/webgpu/); run `npm run build:examples` then `npx serve examples` to preview locally.

There is also an older example, implemented on top of WebGL, if WebGPU does not work for you: [examples/webgl/](./examples/webgl/).

## Controls (Pay Attention)

| Input            | Action                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Mouse drag**   | Pan                                    |
| **Scroll wheel** | Zoom (centered on cursor)              |
| **Double‑click** | Zoom in at that spot                   |
| **Touch drag**   | Pan (mobile)                           |
| **Pinch**        | Zoom (mobile)                          |
| **f** / **F**    | Cycle fractal type forward / backward  |
| **j**            | Toggle Julia picker mode               |
| **+** / **−**    | Increase / decrease iterations         |
| **0**            | Reset iterations to auto‑scaling       |
| **c** / **C**    | Cycle color palette forward / backward |
| **,** / **.**    | Shift colors (fine)                    |
| **<** / **>**    | Shift colors (coarse)                  |
| **r**            | Reset color offset                     |
| **b**            | Extend HDR bright region               |
| **B** (shift)    | Contract HDR bright region             |
| **d**            | Reset HDR brightness                   |
| **1–9**          | Jump to famous locations               |
| **s**            | Copy shareable link to clipboard       |
| **h**            | Toggle help overlay                    |
| **Space**        | Toggle screenshot mode (hides UI)      |

Zoom centers on where you're pointing. Not the center of the screen. Because that would be stupid.

### Famous Locations

Press number keys **1–9** to instantly visit curated fractal locations:

| Key | Location             | Fractal            |
|-----|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1   | Seahorse Valley      | Mandelbrot         |
| 2   | Elephant Valley      | Mandelbrot         |
| 3   | Double Spiral Valley | Mandelbrot         |
| 4   | Spiral Galaxy        | Mandelbrot         |
| 5   | The Armada           | Burning Ship       |
| 6   | Douady Rabbit        | Julia              |
| 7   | Dragon Julia         | Julia              |
| 8   | Lightning Julia      | Julia              |
| 9   | Burning Ship Julia   | Burning Ship Julia |

### Link Sharing

Press **s** to copy a shareable URL to your clipboard. The URL encodes your current position, zoom level, fractal type, color palette, and all settings. Paste the URL to share your exact view with others—or bookmark it to return later.

### Fractal Types

- **Mandelbrot** — The classic set: z = z² + c
- **Burning Ship** — Mandelbrot's angry cousin with absolute values
- **Julia** — Each point in Mandelbrot corresponds to a unique Julia set
- **Burning Ship Julia** — Julia variant of Burning Ship

### Julia Picker Mode

Press **j** to enter Julia picker mode. Click anywhere on the Mandelbrot or Burning Ship to select a Julia constant. The corresponding Julia set (or Burning Ship Julia) will render. Press **j** again to return to your previous fractal and view.

## Tech Stack

| Layer     | Technology  |
|-----------|-------------|
| Language  | TypeScript  |
| Build     | Vite        |
| Rendering | WebGPU      |
| Shaders   | WGSL        |
| HDR       | Extended tone mapping (rgba16float) |

WebGPU, not WebGL. It's 2026 and we're doing this properly. HDR support requires `toneMapping: { mode: 'extended' }` — that's the magic sauce.

`docs/` has the spec and phase‑1 implementation plan. Read them if you want to know *why* things are the way they are.

## Browser Support

WebGPU-capable browsers: Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Firefox Nightly (with WebGPU enabled). Safari support is in progress. Older browsers get a polite error message. Update your stuff.

**HDR Support:** Requires a display that reports `(dynamic-range: high)` to the browser. Most modern HDR monitors and MacBooks with HDR displays work. The app auto-detects and enables HDR when available.
